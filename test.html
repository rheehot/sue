            All I know is We could go anywhere, we could do
            Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
            All I know is Getting lost late at night, under stars
            Finding love standing right where we are, your lips
            They pull me in the moment, you and I alone and
            People may be watching, I don't mind
            'Cause
            Anywhere with you feels right
            Anywhere with you feels like
            Paris in the rain
            Paris in the rain
            We don't need a fancy town
            Or bottles that we can't pronounce
            'Cause anywhere, babe
            Is like Paris in the rain
            When I'm with you
            When I'm with you
            Paris in the rain
            Paris in the rain
            I look at you now and I want this forever
            I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
            Don't know how I ever did it all without you
            My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
            Feelings they come and they go, that they do
            Feelings they come and they go, not with you
            The late nights and the street lights and the people
            Look at me, girl, and the whole world could stop
            Anywhere with you feels right
            Anywhere with you feels like
            Paris in the rain
            Paris in the rain
            We don't need a fancy town
            Or bottles that we can't pronounce
            'Cause anywhere, babe
            Is like Paris in the rain
            When I'm with you
            When I'm with you
            Paris in the rain
            Paris in the rain Girl, when I'm not with you
            All I do is miss you
            So come and set the mood right
            Underneath the moonlight Paint you with my eyes closed
            Wonder where the time goes
            Come and set the mood right
            Underneath the moonlight
            'Cause anywhere with you feel right
            Anywhere with you feels like
            Paris in the rain
            Paris in the rain
            Walking down an empty street
            Puddles underneath our feet 
            You smoked and you looked at me I hate it when you do
            I said “no thanks” to you you asked me If I was okay, what If I wasn’t
            Leaving is fine It’s just I don’t wanna be all by myself again like every time, like every last time
            You knew that I was no good for you when we lay down after doing that things you loved
            you knew that I wasn’t better than you I hope that I could be seemed really fine with you leaving
            You stroked me and stared at me I like it when you do
            I said “I know you love me too” I asked you,
            “If you are the same, what If I quit it”
            Leaving is fine It’s just I don’t wanna be falling behind again
            like every time, like every moment in the end
            You knew that I was no good for you
            when we lay down after doing that things you loved
            you knew that I wasn’t better than you
            I hope that I could be seemed really fine with you leaving
            Suddenly, all the things seem complicated
            you could only fix it but my lips won’t let me tell the truth
            tell me how not to get hurted or broken
            even If you can’t afford loving me anymore
            You knew that I was no good for you
            when we lay down after doing that things you loved
            you knew that I wasn’t better than you
            I hope that I could be seemed really fine with you leaving
            You smoked and you looked at me
            I hate it when you do
